= JSON Binding

This chapter describes the Jakarta JSON Binding. JSON is a data exchange format widely used
in web services and other connected applications. For a brief overview of JSON, see
xref:jsonp/jsonp.adoc#_introduction_to_json[Introduction to JSON].

The httpss://jakarta.ee/specifications/json-binding/[Jakarta JSON Binding] specification provides a standard
binding layer (metadata and runtime) between Java classes and JSON documents. One Jakarta JSON Binding reference
implementation is Yasson, which is developed through Eclipse.org and is included as part of GlassFish Server.
You can learn more about Yasson at https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.yasson.
